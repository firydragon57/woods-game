# woods-game
This is a repository containing the code for my internship project, "The Woods", an 8-bit side-scroller game made with Unity.

All code was developed in C# scripts and implemented in the Unity game engine. This includes scripts for player movement, slime movement, UI controls, spawning controls, parallax effects, sound effects and other logistical aspects of the game.
